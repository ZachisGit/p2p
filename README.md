KVM Image Repository (IPFS)

Decenteralized KVM image repository. Store Virtual Harddrives on ipfs in a repositiry like system.

# What for?
I am developing a mini server hosting system, where small virtual servers are broken down even further into isolated instances that are hosted via KVM.
MiniServer is supposed to be the answer for free, community provided compute for everyone. The goal is to have people buy the cheapest servers all over the world and donate the compute into the world: Africa, Asia, North-America, South-America, Europe and Oceania. This is usefull since in certain places in the world it is hard to get a credit card or have access to a form of western payment that is accepted by hosting providers even in the local region.
